# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is an application created to solve the [*Project: Recipes*](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes) proposed by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The website consists of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
